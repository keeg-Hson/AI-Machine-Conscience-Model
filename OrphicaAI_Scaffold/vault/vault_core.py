Creates and returns fully formulated memory entry from user input.

    retrieves user entry by ID

    """
    retrieves user entries with use of symbolic tagging
    """

    """
    returns a list of letent memories that are likely to become relevant to user down the road.

    """
    fortifies salience of a given user entry, as if it were being consciously recalled.

    global dacay tick: lowers the weighting factor associated with all user entires over time.
