## ok, here we are
A bit more of an esoteric project of mine, more academic in nature more than anything. this poses as a database model that seeks to map out a machine like enviornment similar to how consciousness parses the human subconscious and draws associations with relevance to the world around it. in other words, this is an experiment to see if i can create a machine learning model that can replicate conscious thought processes in a computational enviornment.

## Theory
For the most part, this model will be heavily based on psychology, particularly modeled after the works of qualified and reputable cognitive scientists/psychologists far more capable than i could ever even dream of being. nonetheless, what matters is that their theories and prognoses exist for the taking, providing a sort of human/animal/general cognitive model to spring board off of. 

The essence of this project stems from the idea that humans and machines are more similar than they are different. after all, whats a computer other than an organism created and encased in a metal box instead of flesh? but heres where it gets crazy; computational processes and cognitive processes are near identical to each other. AI, at its very core is the study of trying to replicate conscious patterns in a machine enviornment. nearual mapping, genetic algorithms, machine learning & model classification vs human cognitive recusrsion (in non pretentious speak, learning shit). the parallels are virtually endless, and uncanny with respect to each other. 

Now the technology is here, we have algorithms and classification systems more powerful than ever. we have stockpiled not only all the data that we need, but we now now exactly how to parse it in a way to extract only what is needed with respect to whatever situation in question; effectively, acting like a sort of subconscious/conscious recusion process emulated. 

However, what these technological advances dont yet have is an isolated classification system.

One that is exactly modeled after an individual mind, and individual sentience. building a machine learning model that functions as an individual parsing the immediate and what gets carefully stockpiled via lifetimes of subjective experiences, not just an aimless algorithm parsing and recalibrating a dataset in an endless recursion loop. So thus, though a small scale ML project, this seeks to create conscious/subconscious warehouses of information that parse on a case-by-case basis, and can be added to as per the users liking. the power here comes from the creation of ones own dataset to suit their own needs, accompanied with an in built conscious process (built in via my own ML model archetechture to be). this could be say, social media profiles or journal entries for instance. data is stockpiled, patterns emerged, coorelated, and then recursively recalibrated as a means of mapping out neural processes. from here, this creates a sort of subconscious stockpile that will then be rehashed and distilled by the 'conscious' algorithm. again, the details still need to be fleshed out significantly and i need to read into this more instead of just going off of my own memory alone, but the objective here is to map out the mind, thought processes, and how to coorelate all of this information into a prototype to then expand further.

This could honestly become like some sort of really cool psychology tool i think if i really get this right. may just be some python/SQL/other shit but i trust in me (and after all, ML is getting powerful yall)

## scrap
I wrote the following in like 5 minutes waiting for a coffee, but this highlights the projects main scope quite well i think. its messy, but what are you gonna do about it:

-ML model that weeks to emulate human conscious processes. 

-apends user info/inputs inot a unique dataset, deals with data w/ associated algorithm to be. 

-algorithm to act as 'subset' of users mind/psyche; this is effectively like porting the users conscious stream/sentience into a machine enviornment. 

-this model will also be able to be downloaded (its cognitive workings/profile indicidual user data collective), with the user being able to take their conscious digital profile and port the associated curated dataset/trained ml model elsewhere 
-->(ie: an api feature tht could say, could be paired with a dating app to match two users with similar profiles, or plug in profile with a chatbot to have a life like conversation with them. an automated emailing response system, automated text messages, possibly even phone calls all would be completely doable in theory once rendered with an API funcitonality). 


-this dataset/model can also be plugged into a chatbot/llm feature in which a machine parses the users psychological profile and helps them as is seen fit. this is also a main point of functionality, in which the chatbot will append user findings into their evolving psychological profile. 

-this is also where the user can paste relevant files, social links, or things of that sort to be parsed, appended, and further utilized by the program. 

-key functionality: to build a model that replicates human consciousness and builda a wrokable 'profiling', that will be able to be developed with interaction with the app and then further downloaded and redistributed as seen fit. maybe a future api addition would be useful here
